Red/Yellow Card project
======================

The goal of this project is to create a ubiquitous mobile application to help track behavior between conference attendees.
This project was inspired by the original Red/Yellow Card project that came to be because of interactions at Defcon 2011. Tech conferences in general it can also be a frustrating place for women, who are often the target of harassment. This can range from mildy offensive comments to full on unsolicited groping. Thereâ€™s been a lot of interesting discussion about why these issues are so prevalent. It is also a good time to remind attendees that the harassment that women face at these conferences doesn't completely exist in a vacuum.

It seems like there needs to be a better way of engaging with harassment at any specific conference.

The origins of the red and yellow cards project can be found in two blog posts available at:

Note: I personally feel torn on this subject as I witnessed it first had at a recent conference I attended and sort of couldn't believe my eyes. Before I saw this first hand I wouldn't have believed it. I'm actually trying really hard not to suffer from white knight syndrome but in this case it seems that a simple tool like this should help to reinforce positive behavior amongst peers.
