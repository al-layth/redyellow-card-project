Red/Yellow Card project
======================

This project has its roots in Defcon 2011. Defcon, if you’re not aware, is the worlds largest hacker conference. It takes place every summer in Las Vegas. It is a place for hackers of all types to come together for a bit of fun, learning, and partying. Unfortunately it can also be a frustrating place for women, who are often the target of harassment. This can range from mildy squick-worthy comments (one longtime female attendee who is in her fourth year of also presenting was asked last year why she was wearing her husband’s speaker badge) to full on unsolicited groping (something KC personally experienced last year). There’s been a lot of interesting discussion about about why these issues are so prevalent. KC highly recommends checking out GeekFeminism’s “Issues” category on their wiki, and would suggest the specific entries on tech conferences and harassment as especially relevant to the Defcon discussion. It is also a good time to remind readers that the harassment that women face at Defcon does not exist in a vacuum.

While KC doesn't think Defcon itself is “broken,” it seemed like there needed to be a better way of engaging with harassment at this specific conference. When a friend of a friend suggested the idea of being able to hand out red and yellow cards to offenders, KC kind of jumped on it. KC wrote about this idea and the response she's gotten in two previous blog posts.
